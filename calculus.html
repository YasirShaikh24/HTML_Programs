        <p> <B>Calculus</B> , a branch of Mathematics, developed by <b><i>Newton and Leibniz</i></b> , deals with the study of the rate of change.
        Calculas define formula like f(2)<sup>n</sup> <abbr title="Construction Management">CM</abbr> is generally used in Mathematical models to obtain optional solutions. 
        <i> It helps us to understand the changes between the values which are related by a function.</i> Calculus Math mainly focused on 
        some important topics such as <b> differntiation, integration, limits, fuctions,</b> and so on. Scientific calculations provide formulas like:
        H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></p>
